**unit 2**


1. **Process Definition and States**:
   - A process is a program in execution. It represents a unit of work within the system, including its own code, data, and resources.
   - Various States of a Process:
     - **New**: The process is being created.
     - **Ready**: The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor.
     - **Running**: The process is being executed on a processor.
     - **Blocked (or Waiting)**: The process is waiting for an event, such as I/O completion.
     - **Terminated (or Exit)**: The process has finished its execution.

2. **Components of a Process Control Block (PCB)**:
   A PCB is a data structure that contains information about a process:
   - Process state, priority, and identification.
   - Program counter and CPU registers.
   - Memory management information (base and limit registers).
   - I/O status information.
   - Accounting information.
   - Scheduling information.

3. **Context Switch**:
   A context switch is the process of saving the state of a currently executing process, loading the state of a new process, and transferring control to that process. It involves switching the CPU from one process to another.

4. **Scheduling Criteria**:
   - **CPU Utilization**: Keep the CPU busy.
   - **Throughput**: Maximize the number of processes completed per unit of time.
   - **Turnaround Time**: Minimize the time taken for a process to complete.
   - **Waiting Time**: Minimize the time processes spend waiting in the queue.
   - **Response Time**: Minimize the time taken to respond to user input.

   - Benefits of Threads:
     - Efficient utilization of CPU resources.
     - Faster context switching between threads compared to processes.
     - Better utilization of multiprocessor systems.
     - Improved responsiveness in user interfaces.

6. **Thread Models**:
   - **Many-to-One**: Many user-level threads mapped to one kernel thread. Simple but not suitable for multi-core systems.
   - **One-to-One**: Each user-level thread maps to a kernel thread. Provides better concurrency but may have higher overhead.
   - **Many-to-Many**: Combines advantages of both models, allowing multiple user threads to be mapped to an equal number of kernel threads.

7. **Process Synchronization**:
   Process synchronization ensures that processes or threads cooperate in a way that avoids conflicts and ensures data consistency, especially in a shared resource environment.

8. **Preemptive and Non-preemptive Scheduling Algorithms**:
   - **Preemptive**: Scheduling decisions can be made at any time, including interrupting the currently running process. Examples: Round Robin, Priority Scheduling.
   - **Non-preemptive**: Scheduling decisions are made only when a process gives up the CPU, such as after completing its execution or waiting for I/O. Examples: First-Come, First-Served, Shortest Job Next.

9. **Semaphore and Types**:
   - A semaphore is a synchronization primitive used to control access to resources in a multi-threaded or multi-process environment.
   - Types: Binary Semaphore (0 or 1) and Counting Semaphore (can have a positive integer value).

10. **Critical Section Problem and Conditions**:
   - The Critical Section Problem involves multiple processes sharing a common resource and preventing simultaneous access to that resource to ensure data consistency.
   - Three Conditions to Solve It:
     - **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one process can be in the critical section at a time.
     - **Progress**: If no process is in the critical section and some processes want to enter, only those not in their remainder section can enter.
     - **Bounded Waiting**: There exists a limit on the number of times other processes are allowed to enter the critical section after a process has made a request.



**unit 3**



1. **Deadlock Definition and Example**:
   Deadlock is a situation in which two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for a resource held by another. It's a state where processes are stuck and cannot complete their execution.
   
   **Example**: Consider a dining scenario with philosophers and forks. If each philosopher picks up one fork and waits for another fork held by the adjacent philosopher, a deadlock can occur where no philosopher can eat.

2. **Conditions for Deadlock**:
   For a deadlock to occur, four conditions must be met simultaneously:
   - **Mutual Exclusion**: At least one resource must be held in a non-sharable mode.
   - **Hold and Wait**: Processes can hold resources while waiting for others.
   - **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from processes.
   - **Circular Wait**: There must be a circular chain of two or more processes, each waiting for a resource held by the next.

3. **Dealing with Deadlocks**:
   - **Prevention**: Eliminate one or more of the conditions to prevent deadlocks from occurring.
   - **Avoidance**: Dynamically assess resource allocations to avoid deadlock-prone states. Requires a resource allocation algorithm and knowledge of process behavior.
   - **Detection and Recovery**: Allow deadlocks to occur, then detect and resolve them. Use techniques like Resource Allocation Graphs or Wait For Graphs to detect deadlocks and recover by terminating processes or preempting resources.

4. **Resource Allocation Graph vs. Wait For Graph**:
   - **Resource Allocation Graph**: Represents resource allocation and processes in a directed graph. Contains processes, resources, and edges indicating resource allocations and requests.
   - **Wait For Graph**: Represents processes and resources in a directed graph. Contains processes and resources with edges indicating which processes are waiting for which resources.

5. **Process Termination vs. Resource Preemption**:
   - **Process Termination**: Terminate one or more processes involved in the deadlock. Frees up their resources, resolving the deadlock. May lead to data loss or inconsistency.
   - **Resource Preemption**: Preempt resources from one or more processes and allocate them to others to break the deadlock. Requires a way to save and restore process state. Generally, preemption is preferred because it's less disruptive.

6. **Swapping**:
   Swapping is the process of moving a process from main memory to secondary storage (disk) and vice versa. It's used when memory is full, and the operating system needs to make room for other processes.

7. **Compaction**:
   Compaction is the process of reducing external fragmentation in memory. It involves moving all allocated memory blocks together and freeing up a large contiguous block of memory.

8. **Fragmentation**:
   Fragmentation refers to the wasted memory space that occurs when memory is divided into small chunks due to allocation and deallocation of processes and data. It can be external (free memory fragments too small to allocate) or internal (unused space within a memory block).

9. **Need for Virtual Memory**:
   Virtual memory is needed to provide the illusion of a larger main memory than physically available. It enables running larger programs and efficiently managing memory by using disk storage as an extension of RAM.

10. **Thrashing**:
    Thrashing occurs when the operating system spends more time swapping data between main memory and disk than executing actual processes. It leads to poor performance as the CPU is mainly occupied in managing the excessive swapping activity.

   - **C-LOOK**: Similar to C-SCAN, but reverses direction without moving to the beginning.

3. **Swap-Space Management**:
   Swap space management involves using a dedicated portion of a disk to temporarily store data that is swapped in and out of main memory. It's used when memory is full to allow efficient execution of processes.

4. **Protection Definition and Principles**:
   Protection involves preventing unauthorized access and modifications to resources. Principles of protection:
   - **Least Privilege**: Users should have the least privileges necessary to perform their tasks.
   - **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Access is denied by default; users must be granted access explicitly.
   - **Open Design**: The design should not be a secret; security should not depend on obscurity.
   - **Separation of Privilege**: Critical actions require multiple conditions or permissions.
   - **Economy of Mechanism**: Keep security mechanisms simple.
